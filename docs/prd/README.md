# Product Requirements Documentation (PRD)

## Purpose
This directory contains all product planning, requirements, and future enhancement documentation for the FLRTS-BMAD project.

## Document Structure

### Core Documents
- `requirements.md` - Current release requirements and specifications
- `future-enhancements.md` - Backlog of future improvements and features

### Feature Tracking Methodology (BMAD Approach)

## How to Log Future Ideas

### 1. Categorization
Future improvements are organized into clear categories:
- **Architectural Improvements (AI-*)** - Core system enhancements
- **Phase 2 Features (F2-*)** - Next major release features
- **Phase 3 Features (F3-*)** - Long-term roadmap items
- **Technical Debt (TD-*)** - Refactoring and optimization needs
- **Research Items (R-*)** - Ideas requiring investigation

### 2. Feature Documentation Template
Each feature should include:
```markdown
### [ID]: [Feature Name]
**Status**: 📝 Ideation | 🔍 Research | 📋 Ready | 🚧 In Progress  
**Effort**: Low (days) | Medium (weeks) | High (months)  
**Value**: Low | Medium | High | Critical  
**Dependencies**: [List any prerequisite features]  

**Description**: [1-2 sentence summary]

**Benefits**:
- [Business value point 1]
- [Technical value point 2]

**Implementation Notes**:
[Any technical details, code snippets, or architecture considerations]
```

### 3. Status Lifecycle
- **📝 Ideation** - Raw idea, needs refinement
- **🔍 Research** - Actively investigating feasibility
- **📋 Ready** - Fully specified, ready for development
- **🚧 In Progress** - Currently being implemented
- **✅ Completed** - Implemented and deployed
- **❌ Rejected** - Decided against implementation

### 4. Priority Management
Use effort/value matrix for prioritization:
- **Quick Wins**: Low effort, High value → Do first
- **Major Projects**: High effort, High value → Plan carefully
- **Fill-ins**: Low effort, Low value → Do when convenient
- **Question Marks**: High effort, Low value → Reconsider

### 5. Review Cadence
- **Weekly**: Review "Ready" items for sprint planning
- **Monthly**: Move ideas from Ideation → Research → Ready
- **Quarterly**: Reassess priorities and archive rejected items

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Keep descriptions concise and actionable  
✅ Include rough effort estimates  
✅ Link related features via dependencies  
✅ Add implementation notes while ideas are fresh  
✅ Use consistent ID naming (AI-1, F2-3, etc.)  

### DON'T:
❌ Over-specify features in ideation phase  
❌ Create epics/stories until status is "Ready"  
❌ Let the backlog grow unbounded (archive old items)  
❌ Mix current requirements with future ideas  

## Converting to Development Tasks

When a feature moves to "Ready" status:
1. Create an epic in your project management tool
2. Break down into user stories
3. Add acceptance criteria
4. Estimate story points
5. Move original feature to "In Progress" with epic link

## Archive Policy
Features rejected or not touched for 6 months should be moved to an `archive/` subdirectory with a datestamp.

*This process ensures ideas are captured without disrupting active development, following the BMAD principle of "Document once, refine later."*
