# FLRTS BrainBot Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source
User-provided information: "FLRTS BrainBot Brownfield Architecture Document". My analysis is based entirely on this comprehensive document.

#### Current Project State
The FLRTS BrainBot is a Python and React/TypeScript application designed for low-friction task, list, and note management via a Telegram bot. The system uses Supabase for its database, OpenAI for intelligence, and is in the process of migrating vector/caching services from Upstash to Cloudflare. The core of its logic is the "Smart Rails" system, which preprocesses natural language commands to reduce latency and cost by bypassing LLM calls for high-confidence actions. The application is deployed on Render.com.

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
* Fully complete the infrastructure migration to Cloudflare for vector search and caching.
* Expand the Smart Rails router to handle a wider variety of user inputs with high confidence.
* Implement a direct execution path for high-confidence commands that completely bypasses the LLM.
* Audit and refactor the existing Smart Rails code to ensure it is production-ready.

#### Background Context
The core problem this enhancement solves is the high friction associated with data entry in most task management tools. For a busy, ADHD-prone team, the cognitive load of filling out forms for a simple task is a barrier to capturing ideas. This enhancement aims to create a tool that feels less like software and more like a hyper-competent assistant, reducing cognitive load and ensuring important items are captured the moment they arise.

## Requirements

### Functional

1.  **FR1:** All vector storage and search operations must be fully migrated from the legacy Upstash implementation to the Cloudflare Vectorize service.
2.  **FR2:** All caching logic must be migrated from the legacy Upstash Redis to Cloudflare Workers KV or a suitable Cloudflare Redis alternative.
3.  **FR3:** The codebase must be refactored to remove all dependencies, configuration, and client code related to Upstash.
4.  **FR4:** The Smart Rails router (`src/rails/router.py`) must be enhanced to correctly identify and parse a wider range of natural language commands for **tasks** and **lists**, including variations in phrasing and sentence structure.
5.  **FR5:** A direct execution path must be implemented that, upon receiving a high-confidence result from the Smart Rails router, executes the command using a dedicated processor (e.g., `TaskProcessor`, `ListProcessor`) for **task and list** operations *without* invoking the OpenAI LLM.
6.  **FR6:** The health check endpoint (`GET /health`) must be updated to verify connectivity to the new Cloudflare services (Vectorize, KV/Redis).
7.  **FR7:** The system must support creating **tasks with reminders**. The Smart Rails router should be able to parse natural language for dates and times (e.g., "tomorrow at 3 pm", "in 2 hours").
8.  **FR8:** A mechanism for logging user corrections to bot actions must be implemented. When a user corrects the bot's interpretation, the original message, the bot's action, and the user's correction should be stored in a dedicated Supabase table for future analysis and fine-tuning.

### Non Functional

1.  **NFR1:** High-confidence commands processed via the direct execution path should have a server response time of less than 500ms.
2.  **NFR2:** The system must minimize OpenAI LLM API calls for all core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on **tasks** and **lists**.
3.  **NFR3:** The test suite should prioritize robust coverage for the core "Smart Rails" logic, direct execution paths, and critical integrations. The goal is to ensure development stability, not exhaustive coverage of every possible edge case.
4.  **NFR4:** All new code must adhere to the existing project structure, patterns, and linting rules.
5.  **NFR5:** The `mem0` integration must be fully functional for the MVP to provide a persistent memory layer for conversations.
6.  **NFR6:** The deployed application must be immediately responsive. The time to process the first command after a period of inactivity must not exceed a few seconds, eliminating the current "wake-up" delay.
7.  **NFR7:** The standard automated backup and recovery features provided by Supabase for the database must be enabled.

### Compatibility Requirements

As the application is in a pre-launch state with no active users, there are no strict backward compatibility requirements. **Breaking changes to the API, database, and frontend are permissible** if they accelerate development or result in a better MVP implementation. The focus is on achieving the core functional goals quickly.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

* **Languages**: Python >=3.9, TypeScript ^5.6.0
* **Frameworks**: `python-telegram-bot` 21.0.1, FastAPI 0.111.0, React ^18.3.1
* **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) 2.11.0
* **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare (Vectorize, KV/Redis), Render.com
* **Intelligence & Memory**: OpenAI (GPT-4o), `mem0ai` 0.0.15
* **External Dependencies**: Vite, Tailwind CSS, Docker

### Integration Approach

* **Database Integration Strategy**: The existing Supabase PostgreSQL database will remain the primary store for structured data. A new table will be added to log user corrections as defined in FR8.
* **API Integration Strategy**: The core integration will be internal. The Smart Rails router will act as a controller, dispatching high-confidence commands to dedicated `TaskProcessor` and `ListProcessor` modules. The existing FastAPI webhook will be the main entry point.
* **Cloudflare Integration Strategy**: The `src/storage/vector_store.py` and any Redis-related modules must be refactored to use the official Cloudflare API clients for Vectorize and KV/Redis. All Upstash clients will be removed.
* **Testing Integration Strategy**: The `pytest` integration test suite will need to be adapted to mock or connect to test instances of the Cloudflare services to ensure the new data layer functions correctly.

### Code Organization and Standards

* **File Structure Approach**: New code should follow the existing structure. For example, new Smart Rails logic for lists would go into a new file like `src/rails/processors/list_processor.py`.
* **Naming Conventions**: Adhere to existing conventions for modules, classes, and functions.
* **Coding Standards**: All new Python and TypeScript code must pass the existing linting and formatting checks defined in the project.
* **Documentation Standards**: New modules and complex functions should include docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.

### Deployment and Operations

* **Build Process Integration**: The enhancement should not require changes to the existing build processes (`npm run build` for frontend, standard Python dependency management for backend).
* **Deployment Strategy**: The existing `render.yaml` configuration should be updated if any new environment variables for Cloudflare services are required. The automated deployment from the `main` branch via Render.com will remain the standard process.
* **Monitoring and Logging**: The existing `SupabaseLogger` should be utilized for logging critical events within the new Smart Rails logic, such as direct execution successes, fallbacks to the LLM, and any processing errors.
* **Post-MVP Dev Environment**: To support continued development after launch, a separate preview environment will be established. This includes a process for provisioning distinct Supabase and Cloudflare test instances tied to a `develop` branch, enabling safe testing of changes before merging to `main` for production deployment.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

* **Technical Risks**:
    * **Cloudflare API Differences**: The Cloudflare Vectorize and KV APIs may have different performance characteristics or interfaces than their Upstash counterparts, requiring non-trivial refactoring. **Mitigation**: Conduct a small proof-of-concept for each service before undertaking the full migration.
    * **NLP Accuracy**: The enhanced Smart Rails router might misinterpret user intent, leading to incorrect actions. **Mitigation**: Implement robust logging of router confidence scores and LLM fallbacks (as per FR8) to quickly identify and fine-tune weak points. Start with a very high confidence threshold (e.g., 98%) for direct execution and lower it as performance is validated.
* **Integration Risks**: The `mem0` library is still experimental. Changes could introduce unexpected behavior in conversation memory. **Mitigation**: Pin the library to a specific version and review release notes carefully before upgrading.
* **Deployment Risks**: Incorrectly configured Cloudflare API keys or permissions in the Render.com environment could cause service outages. **Mitigation**: Thoroughly test all new environment variables in a staging or preview environment on Render before merging to `main`.

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: This enhancement will be structured as a **single epic**. This approach ensures that all related work—from the Cloudflare migration to the final Smart Rails logic—is managed as one cohesive and deployable package. It avoids the risk of deploying a partially completed feature.

---
## Epic 1: Smart Rails Hardening & Cloudflare Migration

**Epic Goal**: To deliver a production-ready, zero-friction interface for managing tasks and lists. This will be achieved by completing the full migration to Cloudflare for backend services, refactoring the codebase, and implementing a high-speed, direct execution path for natural language commands that bypasses the LLM.

**Integration Requirements**: This epic will involve significant changes to the data access layer (`src/storage`) and the core command processing logic (`src/rails`).

### Story 1.1: Establish Post-MVP Development Environment
**As a** founder,
**I want** a separate preview environment with its own database and services,
**so that** I can safely test new features after the MVP is launched without affecting the production application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A `develop` branch is created in the Git repository to serve as the integration branch for new features.
2.  A process is documented for provisioning separate Supabase and Cloudflare instances for the preview environment.
3.  The GitHub Actions workflow is updated to deploy the `develop` branch to the preview environment.

### Story 1.2: Migrate Vector Store to Cloudflare Vectorize
**As a** system,
**I want** to use Cloudflare Vectorize for all vector embedding and similarity search operations,
**so that** I can remove the legacy Upstash dependency and consolidate services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new module is created, `src/storage/cloudflare_vector_store.py`, that interfaces with the Cloudflare Vectorize API.
2.  The new module implements methods for creating, updating, and searching for vector embeddings.
3.  All parts of the application that previously used the Upstash vector store are refactored to use the new Cloudflare module.
4.  Integration tests are written to verify the functionality of the new module.

### Story 1.3: Migrate Caching to Cloudflare KV/Redis
**As a** system,
**I want** to use a Cloudflare service (like Workers KV or Redis) for all caching needs,
**so that** conversation history and other temporary data are managed within the Cloudflare ecosystem.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new caching module is created to interface with the chosen Cloudflare caching service.
2.  The `mem0` library and any other components that use Redis are configured to use the new caching module.
3.  Integration tests are written to confirm that caching operations (set, get, delete) work correctly.

### Story 1.4: Codebase Refactor & Upstash Removal
**As a** developer,
**I want** all code, configuration, and documentation related to Upstash to be removed from the codebase,
**so that** the project is clean, maintainable, and free of dead code.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  All Python client libraries for Upstash are removed from `pyproject.toml`.
2.  All environment variables related to Upstash are removed from `.env.example` and `render.yaml`.
3.  Any modules or utility functions specific to Upstash are deleted.
4.  The application runs successfully, and all tests pass after the removal.

### Story 1.5: Enhance Smart Rails Router for Tasks & Lists
**As a** user,
**I want** the Smart Rails router to understand a wider variety of natural language commands for tasks and lists,
**so that** I don't have to think about specific phrasing to get things done.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The keyword and synonym matching logic in `src/rails/router.py` is expanded to cover more common phrases for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks and lists.
2.  The confidence scoring algorithm is tuned to accurately differentiate between high-confidence commands and ambiguous queries.
3.  Unit tests are added to cover at least 10 new phrasing variations for both tasks and lists.

### Story 1.6: Implement Direct Execution Path
**As a** system,
**I want** to execute high-confidence commands directly without calling an LLM,
**so that** the user receives an instant response and operational costs are minimized.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The router, when it calculates a confidence score above a defined threshold (e.g., 95%), now calls a dedicated processor (e.g., `TaskProcessor`) instead of the LLM module.
2.  The `TaskProcessor` and a new `ListProcessor` contain the business logic to perform CRUD operations against the Supabase database.
3.  The response time for these direct commands is under 500ms as per NFR1.
4.  If a processor fails during execution, the user receives an informative but user-friendly error message. The message should indicate the nature of the problem (e.g., 'I couldn't connect to the database to save your task,' or 'The reminder time you provided is in the past') without exposing technical details. The full technical error must be logged for debugging.

### Story 1.7: Implement Task Reminders
**As a** user,
**I want** to add reminders to my tasks using natural language (e.g., "remind me in 1 hour"),
**so that** I don't miss important deadlines.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The Smart Rails router can identify and parse date/time information from a message.
2.  When a task is created with a reminder, a scheduled job or event is created to trigger a notification at the specified time.
3.  The user receives a Telegram message from the bot when the reminder is due.

### Story 1.8: Implement User Correction Logging
**As a** founder,
**I want** the system to log instances where a user corrects the bot,
**so that** I can use this data in the future to fine-tune and improve the system's accuracy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new table, `user_corrections`, is created in the Supabase database.
2.  A mechanism (e.g., a `/fix` command or a reply-based trigger) is implemented for the user to report an incorrect action.
3.  When a correction is logged, the original message, the bot's incorrect action, and the user's corrective feedback are saved to the new table.

### Story 1.9: Update Health Check Endpoint
**As a** developer,
**I want** the health check endpoint to verify connectivity to all external services,
**so that** I can quickly diagnose system-wide issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The `GET /health` endpoint is updated to include checks for Cloudflare Vectorize and the Cloudflare caching service.
2.  The endpoint returns a success status only if all services (Supabase, Cloudflare, OpenAI) are reachable.

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

This section serves as a high-level backlog for future epics to be planned after a successful MVP launch.

* **Migrate Backend from Render to Cloudflare:**
    * Re-implement the Python FastAPI backend as a serverless Cloudflare Worker.
    * This will consolidate the entire stack onto Cloudflare, eliminating the Render dependency.
* **Implement V2 of the Learning System:**
    * Use the data collected by the User Correction Logging feature (Story 1.8) to actively fine-tune the Smart Rails router.
    * Investigate using the data to create user-specific routing rules and preferences.
* **Periodically Review Cloudflare Workers AI:**
    * Monitor the models available on Workers AI to see if any meet the capability requirements to potentially replace OpenAI for cost and latency savings.
