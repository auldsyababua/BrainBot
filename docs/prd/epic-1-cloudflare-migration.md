**so that** all caching is handled by Cloudflare services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Conversation history stored in Cloudflare KV
2. Router cache uses Cloudflare KV
3. Session data managed via Cloudflare KV
4. Performance maintains current levels

### Story 1.4: Migrate Backend to Cloudflare Workers
**As a** system,
**I want** to migrate the FastAPI backend from Render.com to Cloudflare Workers,
**so that** the entire stack runs on Cloudflare infrastructure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. FastAPI webhook converted to Cloudflare Workers
2. Telegram bot integration works correctly
3. Smart Rails routing functions in Workers environment
4. Database connections optimized for Workers

### Story 1.5: Deploy Mini-App on Cloudflare Pages
**As a** user,
**I want** the Telegram Mini-App hosted on Cloudflare Pages,
**so that** I have a fast, reliable interface for complex operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. React Mini-App builds and deploys to Cloudflare Pages

3. Backend API calls work from Pages to Workers
4. Authentication via Telegram WebApp data functions

### Story 1.6: Implement Task Reminders
**As a** user,
**I want** to set reminders for my tasks using natural language,
**so that** I don't miss important deadlines.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Smart Rails router parses date/time from natural language
2. Reminders scheduled using Cloudflare Cron Triggers or Durable Objects
3. Reminder notifications sent via Telegram bot
4. Users can snooze or dismiss reminders

### Story 1.7: Optimize Smart Rails Direct Execution
**As a** user,
**I want** high-confidence commands to execute immediately,
**so that** I get sub-500ms responses for common operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. TaskProcessor and ListProcessor handle direct execution
2. Confidence threshold tuned for optimal accuracy (95%+)
3. Response times consistently under 500ms
4. Graceful fallback to LLM for low-confidence commands

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- Smart Rails direct execution: <500ms
- Vector search queries: <1s  
- Mini-App initial load: <2s
- File upload to R2: <5s

### Infrastructure Requirements
- All services hosted on Cloudflare
- Wrangler-compatible deployment structure
- Environment variable management via Cloudflare
- Monitoring via Cloudflare Analytics

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Service Migrations
Complete all Upstash â†’ Cloudflare service migrations while maintaining current functionality.

### Phase 2: Backend Migration
Migrate from Render.com to Cloudflare Workers with thorough testing.

### Phase 3: Frontend Deployment
Deploy Mini-App to Cloudflare Pages with full Telegram integration.

### Phase 4: Optimization
Tune Smart Rails performance and implement task reminders.

## Success Metrics

- Zero downtime during migrations
- Performance targets met or exceeded
- All functionality working on Cloudflare infrastructure
- No remaining dependencies on Upstash or AWS
- GitHub tests passing consistently
