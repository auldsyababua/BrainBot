### üìã REMAINING STORIES (Priority Order)

### Story 2.4: Test File Naming Cleanup (3 points) - HIGH PRIORITY
**As a** developer,
**I want** all test files to have proper names without temporary suffixes,
**so that** the codebase looks professional and tests are easy to locate.

**Problem**: 8 test files have temporary suffixes (_refactored, _proper, _direct, _standalone)

**Files to Rename**:
```
tests/unit/test_llm_refactored.py ‚Üí test_llm.py
tests/unit/test_router_refactored.py ‚Üí test_router.py
tests/unit/test_dynamic_prompting_proper.py ‚Üí test_dynamic_prompting.py
tests/unit/test_smart_rails_proper.py ‚Üí test_smart_rails.py
tests/integration/test_smart_rails_integration_proper.py ‚Üí test_smart_rails_integration.py
tests/unit/test_list_processor_direct.py ‚Üí test_list_processor.py
tests/unit/test_task_processor_direct.py ‚Üí test_task_processor.py
tests/test_dynamic_prompting_standalone.py ‚Üí tests/unit/test_dynamic_prompting_standalone.py
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] No test files with temporary suffixes
- [ ] All tests in appropriate directories
- [ ] All tests still pass

### Story 2.5: Remove Manual Memory Management (8 points) - UPDATED
**As a** developer,
**I want** to remove unnecessary manual memory management code,
**so that** the codebase follows Python best practices.

**Problem**: Manual `del` statements exist in codebase (Story previously described non-existent gc.collect() issues)

**Current Reality Check**: 
- ‚úÖ No `gc.collect()` calls found (already cleaned up)
- ‚ùå Manual `del` statements may exist (needs verification)
- ‚ùå No streaming implementation for large responses
- ‚ùå No memory monitoring for debugging

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Identify and remove any manual `del` statements
- [ ] Verify no `gc.collect()` calls remain
- [ ] Add memory monitoring for debugging if needed
- [ ] Consider streaming implementation for large responses

### Story 2.6: Externalize Configuration (5 points) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**As a** developer,
**I want** hardcoded configuration values moved to a central config file,
**so that** settings are easily manageable and environment-specific.

**Create**: `src/BrainBot/config/defaults.py`
```python
# Cache Configuration  
CACHE_TTL_DEFAULT = 300  # 5 minutes
ROUTER_CACHE_TTL = 1800  # 30 minutes
SYNONYM_CACHE_TTL = 3600  # 1 hour
REDIS_TTL = 86400  # 24 hours

# Size Limits
MAX_CACHE_SIZE = 1000
MAX_HEALTH_HISTORY = 100

# Memory Configuration
MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH = 2000
```

**Files to Update**:
- `router.py:394` - cache TTL
- `synonym_library.py:16-17` - cache settings  
- `redis_store.py:23` - TTL
- `storage_service.py:48` - cache TTL
- `health_checks.py:34` - history limit

### Story 2.7: Complete TODO Items (3 points) - LOW PRIORITY
**As a** developer,
**I want** all TODO comments resolved,
**so that** the codebase is complete and maintainable.

**Tasks**:
1. Fix async memory initialization (`webhook_bot.py:243`)
2. Add vector search logging (`handlers.py:229`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All TODO comments resolved or removed
- [ ] Memory system properly initialized
- [ ] Vector search operations logged

### Story 2.8: Standardize HTTP Status Codes (2 points) - LOW PRIORITY
**As a** developer,
**I want** magic numbers replaced with named constants,
**so that** code is more readable and maintainable.

**Changes**:
```python
from http import HTTPStatus
# Replace 200 ‚Üí HTTPStatus.OK
# Replace 404 ‚Üí HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND  
# Replace 503 ‚Üí HTTPStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE
```

**Files**: `performance_alerts.py`, `cloudflare_cache.py`, `health/endpoints.py`

### Story 2.9: AWS S3 to Cloudflare R2 Migration (8 points) - CRITICAL
**As a** developer,
**I want** media storage migrated from AWS S3 to Cloudflare R2,
**so that** the system follows the Cloudflare-first architecture.

**Problem**: `media_storage.py` still uses boto3 and AWS S3

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Replace boto3 with Cloudflare R2 API
- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Migrate existing media files
- [ ] Update deployment configuration

### Story 2.10: Fix GitHub Test Failures (13 points) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
**As a** developer,
**I want** all GitHub tests to pass consistently,
**so that** code can be merged to the develop branch and deployed.

**Problem**: Tests failing, blocking develop branch merges

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Identify root cause of test failures
- [ ] Fix failing tests without breaking functionality
- [ ] Ensure tests pass in both local and GitHub environments
- [ ] Document any test infrastructure changes needed

### Story 2.11: Backend Cloudflare Workers Migration (21 points) - FUTURE
**As a** system,
**I want** the FastAPI backend migrated to Cloudflare Workers,
**so that** the entire stack runs on Cloudflare infrastructure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] FastAPI routes converted to Workers handlers
- [ ] Database connections optimized for Workers
- [ ] Webhook handling works correctly
- [ ] Performance meets current benchmarks

## Implementation Priority

1. **Story 2.10**: Fix GitHub Tests (CRITICAL - unblocks development)
2. **Story 2.9**: R2 Migration (CRITICAL - completes infrastructure) 
3. **Story 2.4**: Test Cleanup (HIGH - quick professional win)
4. **Story 2.5**: Memory Management (MEDIUM - cleanup)
5. **Story 2.6**: Configuration (MEDIUM - maintainability)
6. **Story 2.7**: TODOs (LOW - housekeeping)
7. **Story 2.8**: HTTP Status (LOW - code quality)
8. **Story 2.11**: Workers Migration (FUTURE - major undertaking)

## Success Metrics

- All GitHub tests passing consistently
- Successful merges to develop branch
- Zero temporary file names in codebase
- Complete Cloudflare infrastructure migration
- Documentation matches implementation reality
