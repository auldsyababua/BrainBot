# Storage Migration Checklist

## Overview

This checklist helps track the migration from scattered storage calls to the unified storage interface.

## Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Review current storage usage patterns
- [ ] Identify all direct storage imports
- [ ] Create migration branch from main
- [ ] Set up migration tracking

## Files to Migrate

### Core Modules

- [ ] **src/core/llm.py**
  - [ ] Replace `redis_store` imports
  - [ ] Replace `vector_store` imports
  - [ ] Update `search_knowledge_base()` to use `search_context()`
  - [ ] Update conversation management calls
  - [ ] Test with `test_performance.py`

- [ ] **src/bot/handlers.py**
  - [ ] Update document storage calls
  - [ ] Update media handling
  - [ ] Ensure error handling is consistent
  - [ ] Test with local_dev.py

- [ ] **src/bot/webhook_bot.py**
  - [ ] Update any direct storage references
  - [ ] Ensure metrics endpoint works
  - [ ] Test webhook functionality

### Storage Modules

- [ ] **src/storage/__init__.py**
  - [ ] Export unified_storage as default
  - [ ] Add deprecation warnings for direct imports

- [ ] **src/migrations/*.py**
  - [ ] Update migration scripts to use unified storage
  - [ ] Test migration functionality

### Tools and Utilities

- [ ] **src/core/tools.py**
  - [ ] Update file operations if they use storage
  - [ ] Ensure consistency with unified interface

- [ ] **scripts/export_metrics.py**
  - [ ] Update to use unified storage for metrics
  - [ ] Test export functionality

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Create `tests/test_unified_storage.py`
- [ ] Test each unified method
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test batch operations
- [ ] Test cache invalidation

### Integration Tests

- [ ] **tests/integration/test_storage_integrations.py**
  - [ ] Add unified storage tests
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
  - [ ] Test health checks

### Performance Tests

- [ ] **tests/test_performance.py**
  - [ ] Add unified storage benchmarks
  - [ ] Compare performance before/after
  - [ ] Ensure no regression

### End-to-End Tests

- [ ] Test complete message flow
- [ ] Test document creation and retrieval
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test conversation persistence

## Migration Verification

### Code Quality

- [ ] All storage imports go through unified interface
- [ ] No direct imports in business logic
- [ ] Type hints complete
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Performance

- [ ] Benchmark results documented
- [ ] Cache hit rates maintained
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Response times acceptable

### Functionality

- [ ] All features work as before
- [ ] Error messages are clear
- [ ] Graceful degradation works
- [ ] Health checks pass

## Post-Migration

- [ ] Remove old compatibility code
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create migration guide for other developers
- [ ] Plan for Issue #8 (async conversion)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. [ ] Keep old storage modules intact during migration
2. [ ] Use feature flags to toggle between old/new
3. [ ] Have quick rollback script ready
4. [ ] Document any issues encountered

## Sign-off

- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for production
