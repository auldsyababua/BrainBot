# Frontend Build Tools Resolution - Node.js Compatibility Fix

## Issue Summary
**Date Resolved:** 2025-08-26  
**Resolved By:** Winston (System Architect)  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem
Frontend TypeScript and build tools (tsc, vite, npm, eslint) were timing out and entering infinite loops, blocking CI/CD deployment.

## Root Cause
Node.js v24.4.1 (bleeding edge) incompatibility with TypeScript/Vite ecosystem. The toolchain wasn't ready for v24's internal changes.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Downgrade
```bash
# Downgraded from Node v24.4.1 to v20.19.4 LTS
brew unlink node
brew install node@20
brew link --overwrite node@20
```

### 2. Clean Rebuild
```bash
cd telegram-mini-app
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## Verification Results

✅ **All build tools now functional:**
- TypeScript: `npm run typecheck` - Working (38 type errors to address separately)
- ESLint: `npm run lint` - Working (5 warnings, 0 errors)
- Vite Build: `npm run build` - Success in 1.05s
- Tests: `npm run test:run` - 81 tests passing

## Lessons Learned

1. **Stay on LTS for Production**: Node v20 LTS provides stability for CI/CD pipelines
2. **Version Compatibility**: Bleeding edge Node versions may break toolchain compatibility
3. **Clean State Important**: Always clear node_modules when switching Node versions

## Recommendations for Team

### Immediate Actions
1. Update local development environments to Node v20 LTS
2. Add `.nvmrc` file with `20.19.4` for consistency
3. Update CI/CD pipelines to use Node v20

### Long-term Strategy
1. Pin Node version in package.json engines field
2. Regular dependency audits for compatibility
3. Test major Node upgrades in isolated environments first

## Next Steps

The frontend is now unblocked for deployment. TypeScript errors exist but don't block the build - these should be addressed in a separate story for code quality.

### Create New Story for TypeScript Cleanup
- Fix 38 TypeScript errors
- Update type definitions
- Ensure strict type checking passes

## Environment Configuration

```json
// Recommended package.json addition
"engines": {
  "node": ">=20.0.0 <21.0.0",
  "npm": ">=10.0.0"
}
```

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Check current versions
node --version  # Should be v20.x.x
npm --version   # Should be 10.x.x

# Run verification suite
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:run
```

**Architecture Decision:** Prioritize stability over bleeding-edge features for production systems.
