                       └──────────────────┘
```

### Data Flow

1. **Input**: User messages, document content, explicit relationship data
2. **Processing**: mem0 intelligent extraction + custom relationship logic
3. **Storage**: Dual storage in vector store (similarity) and graph database (relationships)
4. **Retrieval**: Hybrid search combining vector similarity and graph traversal
5. **Output**: Enhanced context with relationship information

### Entity Types Supported

- **Location**: Facilities, sites, geographic locations
- **Organization**: Companies, partners, investors
- **Equipment**: Pumps, systems, tools, machinery
- **Activity**: Tasks, checklists, reports, processes
- **Concept**: General entities and abstract concepts

## Deployment Considerations

### Development Setup
- Can run without Neo4j (degrades gracefully)
- Vector memory continues to work independently
- Full functionality requires Neo4j database

### Production Setup
- Neo4j database required for graph features
- Consider Neo4j clustering for high availability
- Monitor graph database size and performance
- Implement backup and recovery procedures

### Migration Path
- Existing installations: Add dependencies and configuration
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Gradual rollout possible (graph features are additive)

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for:

- **Advanced Visualization**: Neo4j Browser integration and custom dashboards
- **Machine Learning**: Graph neural networks for relationship prediction
- **Analytics**: Network analysis and community detection
- **Integration**: Connect with external knowledge graphs and ontologies
- **Automation**: Intelligent relationship extraction from documents

## Conclusion
