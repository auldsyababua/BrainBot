# Story 2.5: Remove Manual Memory Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to remove unnecessary manual memory management code,
**so that** the codebase follows Python best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Identify and remove any manual `del` statements
2. [ ] Verify no `gc.collect()` calls remain
3. [ ] Add memory monitoring for debugging if needed
4. [ ] Consider streaming implementation for large responses

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Audit codebase for manual memory management (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Search for all `del` statements in src/ directory using grep
  - [ ] Search for any `gc.collect()` calls to verify none exist
  - [ ] Document findings with file paths and line numbers
  - [ ] Assess if any `del` statements are actually necessary
- [ ] Task 2: Remove unnecessary memory management code (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Remove identified unnecessary `del` statements
  - [ ] Ensure code still functions correctly after removal
  - [ ] Update any related comments or documentation
- [ ] Task 3: Implement proper memory patterns (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Evaluate if memory monitoring is needed for debugging
  - [ ] If needed, add memory profiling decorators to src/monitoring/
  - [ ] Research streaming implementation for LLM responses
  - [ ] Document recommendations for future memory optimization
- [ ] Task 4: Testing and validation (All ACs)
  - [ ] Run unit tests to ensure no regressions
  - [ ] Check memory usage patterns with sample workloads
  - [ ] Verify application performance is maintained

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1-2.3 have successfully cleaned up test artifacts, decomposed large functions, and refactored the router. The codebase is now more maintainable with proper test coverage.

### Technical Context
**Problem Statement from PRD:**
- Manual `del` statements exist in codebase (previously incorrectly described gc.collect() issues)
- No gc.collect() calls found (already cleaned up)
- Manual del statements may exist (needs verification)
- No streaming implementation for large responses currently
- No memory monitoring for debugging

### Relevant Source Tree
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- `src/core/` - Core application logic including LLM and memory modules
- `src/monitoring/` - Monitoring and logging components (potential location for memory monitoring)
- `src/rails/` - Smart Rails message processing (may contain manual memory management)
- `src/bot/` - Bot logic and handlers (check for del statements)

### Python Best Practices
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Python 3.9+ is used throughout the project
- Code should follow modern Python standards
- All functions should include type hints
- Black formatting with 88 character line length
- Ruff for linting

### Memory Management Patterns
Python uses automatic garbage collection, making manual memory management unnecessary in most cases. The following patterns should be used:
- Let objects go out of scope naturally for garbage collection
- Use context managers (`with` statements) for resource management
- Streaming/generator patterns for large data processing
- Weak references only when circular references are unavoidable

### Search Commands for Dev Agent
```bash
# Find all del statements
grep -r "del " src/ --include="*.py"

# Verify no gc.collect() calls
grep -r "gc.collect" src/ --include="*.py"

# Check for import gc statements
grep -r "import gc" src/ --include="*.py"
```

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-standards]
- Test file location: `tests/unit/` for unit tests
- Testing framework: Pytest 7.x
- Use `unittest.mock` and `pytest-mock` for mocking
- Each source file should have corresponding test file
- Tests should follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Minimum 80% line coverage required
- Core modules require 90% coverage

### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Create or update tests in `tests/unit/` for any modified modules
- Ensure tests verify proper memory cleanup without manual intervention
- Add performance tests if implementing streaming
- Run full test suite with `pytest tests/unit/`
- Generate coverage report with `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html`
