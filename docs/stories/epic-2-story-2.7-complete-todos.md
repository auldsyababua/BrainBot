# Story 2.7: Complete TODO Items

**Priority:** LOW
**Points:** 3
**Status:** Ready for Development

## User Story
As a developer, I need all TODO comments either implemented or removed so the codebase doesn't have unfinished work markers.

## Problem
TODO comments indicate incomplete implementation, which can lead to bugs or missing functionality in production.

## Known TODO Items
1. **Async Memory Initialization** (`webhook_bot.py:243`)
   - Current: Memory system may not be properly initialized
   - Fix: Implement proper async initialization pattern

2. **Vector Search Logging** (`handlers.py:229`)
   - Current: Vector search operations not logged
   - Fix: Add comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Implementation Tasks
1. **Audit Phase**:
   - Search for all TODO, FIXME, XXX, HACK comments
   - Document each item found
   - Categorize by priority and complexity

2. **Resolution Phase**:
   - Fix async memory initialization in webhook_bot.py
   - Add vector search logging in handlers.py
   - Address any other TODOs found during audit

3. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - Remove completed TODO comments
   - Convert unfixable TODOs to GitHub issues
   - Add proper documentation for deferred items

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All TODO comments resolved or removed
- [ ] Memory system properly initialized in webhook_bot.py
- [ ] Vector search operations logged in handlers.py
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK comments remain
- [ ] GitHub issues created for deferred work
- [ ] All changes tested and documented

## Developer Notes
- Some TODOs may indicate future enhancements (convert to issues)
- Others may be outdated (safe to remove)
- Critical TODOs should be fixed immediately
- Add tests for any new functionality added

### Status
Approved
