# Story 2.1: Decompose process_message() Function

**Priority:** HIGH
**Points:** 13
**Status:** COMPLETED

## User Story
As a developer, I need the process_message() function refactored into smaller, testable methods so I can understand and maintain the code more easily.

## Problem
The process_message() function was 359 lines long, making it difficult to understand, test, and maintain.

## Implementation Completed
- **Date Completed:** Prior to 2025-08-25
- **Agent Model Used:** Unknown (completed before current sprint)

## Changes Made
1. Extracted 4 focused methods from the monolithic function:
   - Input validation method
   - Message processing logic
   - Response formatting
   - Error handling
2. Added comprehensive unit tests (13 test cases)
3. Maintained exact same public API
4. Improved code readability and maintainability

## Files Modified
- `src/flrts/core/llm.py` - Refactored process_message() function
- `tests/unit/test_llm_refactored.py` - Added 13 test cases

## Test Coverage
- 13 test cases passing
- Coverage includes:
  - Input validation scenarios
  - Message processing logic
  - Response formatting
  - Error handling paths
  - Edge cases

## Acceptance Criteria (COMPLETED)
- [x] process_message() function broken into multiple methods
- [x] Each method has single responsibility
- [x] All 13 test cases passing
- [x] Public API unchanged
- [x] Performance maintained

## QA Notes
- Verify all test cases pass
- Confirm API compatibility with existing code
- Check performance metrics remain within acceptable range

### Status
Approved
