# Story 2.2: Refactor KeywordRouter.route() Method

**Priority:** HIGH
**Points:** 8
**Status:** COMPLETED

## User Story
As a developer, I need the KeywordRouter.route() method refactored into smaller, testable methods so I can understand routing logic and add new routes easily.

## Problem
The KeywordRouter.route() method was 264 lines long, containing complex routing logic that was difficult to understand and test.

## Implementation Completed
- **Date Completed:** Prior to 2025-08-25
- **Agent Model Used:** Unknown (completed before current sprint)

## Changes Made
1. Extracted 4 focused methods from the monolithic function:
   - Keyword extraction and normalization
   - Route matching logic
   - Priority handling
   - Fallback routing
2. Added comprehensive unit tests (20 test cases)
3. Maintained performance within requirements
4. Improved code organization and readability

## Files Modified
- `src/brainbot/core/router.py` - Refactored KeywordRouter.route() method
- `tests/unit/test_router_refactored.py` - Added 20 test cases

## Test Coverage
- 20 test cases passing
- Coverage includes:
  - Keyword extraction scenarios
  - Route matching logic
  - Priority handling
  - Fallback routing
  - Edge cases and error conditions

## Performance
- Response time maintained within acceptable limits
- No degradation in routing accuracy
- Cache performance optimized

## Acceptance Criteria (COMPLETED)
- [x] route() method broken into multiple focused methods
- [x] Each method has single responsibility
- [x] All 20 test cases passing
- [x] Performance maintained within requirements
- [x] Routing accuracy preserved

## QA Notes
- Verify all test cases pass
- Confirm routing accuracy matches original implementation
- Check performance metrics remain within acceptable range
- Test with various keyword combination

### Status
Approved
