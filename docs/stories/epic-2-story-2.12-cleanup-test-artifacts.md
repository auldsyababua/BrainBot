# Story 2.12: Clean Up Broken Test Artifacts

**Priority:** LOW
**Points:** 1
**Status:** Ready for Development

## User Story
As a developer, I need broken test artifacts and obsolete scripts removed from the codebase so it's clear what testing infrastructure is actually functional.

## Problem
The codebase contains broken test infrastructure from previous project iterations that creates confusion:
- Test result directories with stale data from different projects
- Scripts that reference non-existent test files
- No current tests or CI/CD actually use these artifacts

## Current State Analysis
1. **`tests/test_results/`** directory:
   - Contains JSON files from February 2025
   - Files reference old project paths (flrts-bmad, markdown-brain-bot)
   - Generated by `test_ai_babysitter.sh` which references non-existent tests

2. **`tests/reports/`** directory:
   - Contains single markdown report from August 2025
   - No active script generates these
   - Appears to be a one-off manual review

3. **Broken Scripts**:
   - `scripts/development/test_ai_babysitter.sh` - references `tests/system/test_ai_babysitter.py` which doesn't exist
   - `scripts/development/view_test_history.sh` - tries to read the broken test results

## Implementation Tasks
1. Delete obsolete directories:
   - Remove `tests/test_results/` completely
   - Remove `tests/reports/` completely

2. Delete broken scripts:
   - Remove `scripts/development/test_ai_babysitter.sh`
   - Remove `scripts/development/view_test_history.sh`

3. Update `.gitignore` to prevent future clutter:
   ```
   # Test output
   tests/output/
   test-results.xml
   test-output.json
   htmlcov/
   .coverage
   coverage.xml
   ```

4. Document proper test output generation in README:
   - How to generate coverage reports
   - How to generate JSON/XML output if needed
   - Where test artifacts should go

## Commands to Execute
```bash
# Remove broken test artifacts
rm -rf tests/test_results/
rm -rf tests/reports/

# Remove broken scripts
rm scripts/development/test_ai_babysitter.sh
rm scripts/development/view_test_history.sh

# Verify nothing references these
grep -r "test_results\|test_ai_babysitter\|view_test_history" . --exclude-dir=.git
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No `tests/test_results/` directory exists
- [ ] No `tests/reports/` directory exists  
- [ ] Broken scripts removed
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated to prevent recreation
- [ ] No remaining references to deleted items
- [ ] README documents proper test output generation

## Developer Notes
- These are artifacts from previous project iterations
- The JSON files contain timestamps from February 2025 but reference old project names
- No current CI/CD workflows or test commands use these directories
- Standard pytest output options should be used instead:
  - `pytest --cov-report=html` for coverage
  - `pytest --json-report` if JSON needed
  - `pytest --junitxml=results.xml` for CI/CD
  
### Status
Approved
