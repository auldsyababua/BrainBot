# Story 2.5: Remove Manual Memory Management

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Points:** 8
**Status:** Ready for Development

## User Story
As a developer, I need the codebase to rely on Python's automatic memory management instead of manual interventions so the code is cleaner and more maintainable.

## Problem
Manual memory management techniques may exist in the codebase, which is unnecessary in Python and can indicate poor understanding of the language's garbage collection.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ NO `gc.collect()` calls found (already cleaned up)
- ❌ Need to verify any manual `del` statements exist
- ❌ No streaming implementation for large responses
- ❌ No memory monitoring for debugging

## Implementation Tasks
1. **Audit Phase**:
   - Search for all `del` statements in codebase
   - Document why each `del` exists
   - Determine if any are necessary

2. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - Remove unnecessary `del` statements
   - Replace with proper scoping or context managers
   - Add comments explaining any retained `del` statements

3. **Enhancement Phase**:
   - Add memory monitoring for debugging (if needed)
   - Consider streaming implementation for large responses
   - Add memory profiling hooks for development

## Files to Review
- `src/flrts/core/llm.py` - Primary target
- All files with large data processing
- Any files handling media or documents

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All unnecessary `del` statements removed
- [ ] Any retained `del` statements have clear documentation
- [ ] No `gc.collect()` calls remain (already verified)
- [ ] Memory monitoring added if beneficial
- [ ] Consider streaming for large responses
- [ ] Code review confirms proper memory patterns

## Developer Notes
- Python's garbage collector handles memory automatically
- `del` only removes name binding, doesn't guarantee memory release
- Context managers (with statements) are preferred for resource management
- Profile memory usage before and after changes if concerned

### Status
Approved
