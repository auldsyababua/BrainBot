# Story 2.0: Remove Agent Selection Contamination

**Priority:** HIGH
**Points:** 5
**Status:** COMPLETED

## User Story
As a developer, I need the application to use only GPT-4o directly without agent selection code contaminating the codebase.

## Problem
Agent selection code from development environment was contaminating production code, causing confusion for AI developers working on the project.

## Implementation Completed
- **Date Completed:** Prior to 2025-08-25
- **Agent Model Used:** Unknown (completed before current sprint)

## Changes Made
1. Deleted `src/brainbot_bmad/core/agents.py` module
2. Removed all agent-related imports from `llm.py`
3. Removed all agent selection logic from codebase
4. Application now uses GPT-4o directly without agent wrapper

## Files Modified
- `src/brainbot_bmad/core/agents.py` - DELETED
- `src/brainbot_bmad/core/llm.py` - Cleaned of agent imports and logic
- Various import statements across codebase

## Acceptance Criteria (COMPLETED)
- [x] No agent.py module exists in production code
- [x] No agent-related imports remain
- [x] Application uses GPT-4o directly
- [x] All tests pass without agent selection code

## QA Notes
- Verify no references to agent selection remain
- Confirm direct GPT-4o calls work correctly
- Check for any broken imports or dependencies
