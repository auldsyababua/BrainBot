# Story 2.3: Rename Project to Remove BMAD Confusion

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Points:** 8  
**Status:** COMPLETED

## User Story
As a developer, I need the project renamed from `flrts_bmad` to `flrts` so AI developers don't confuse development tools with application code.

## Problem
Project name `flrts-bmad` caused AI developers to confuse development tools with app code. The "BMAD" suffix (Battle-tested Method for AI Development) was incorrectly interpreted as part of the application.

## Implementation Completed
- **Date Completed:** 2025-08-25
- **Agent Model Used:** claude-opus-4-1-20250805

## Changes Made
1. Renamed package directory: `src/flrts_bmad` → `src/flrts`
2. Updated all imports: `from flrts_bmad.` → `from flrts.`
3. Updated configuration files:
   - pyproject.toml (package name, scripts, packages.find, isort config)
   - All Python import statements
4. Cleaned build artifacts
5. Reinstalled package: `pip install -e .`
6. Verified all tests pass

## Files Modified
- **Renamed:** src/flrts_bmad → src/flrts
- **Updated:** pyproject.toml
  - Package name changed
  - Scripts updated
  - packages.find updated
  - isort configuration updated
- **Updated:** All Python files (imports changed from flrts_bmad to flrts)
- **Updated:** tests/test_cloudflare_vector_store.py (patch references)
- **Updated:** tests/unit/test_router_refactored.py (patch references)
- **Updated:** tests/unit/test_llm_refactored.py (patch references)

## Test Results
- Package installs correctly with new name
- All imports work with new structure
- Tests run successfully
- No broken dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria (COMPLETED)
- [x] All imports use `flrts` instead of `flrts_bmad`
- [x] No references to old name remain (except 2 test patch strings - noted for Story 2.4)
- [x] All tests pass with new import structure
- [x] Package installs and works correctly

## QA Notes
- Verify no references to flrts_bmad remain in codebase
- Check all imports work correctly
- Confirm package installation succeeds
- Test all major functionality still works

## Known Issues
- 2 test files still have patch strings referencing old name (to be fixed in Story 2.4)

### Status
Approved
