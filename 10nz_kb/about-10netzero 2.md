## 🧩 Summary & Strategic Differentiators

1. No upfront cost to oil/gas operators—10NetZero deploys and monetizes via electricity/BTC production ([CalWater Board][3], [10NetZero][4], [DoD Standards of Conduct Office][5], [10NetZero][1]).
2. Fully managed sites include monitoring/maintenance for off-grid energy assets ([10NetZero][2]).
3. ESG + Economics: Flared gas repurposed into revenue & emission reductions aligns with regulatory goals.
4. Niche expertise: Unique combination of oil/gas engineering and Bitcoin infrastructure deployment.
