# BrainBot Requirements Specification

## Overview

BrainBot is an intelligent Telegram bot that acts as a personal filing assistant using Creation Augmented Generation (CAG). It automatically organizes information without asking questions, preserving all sources with an audit trail.

## User Stories and Requirements

### 1. Core Bot Functionality

#### US-1.1: Bot Initialization
**As a** team member  
**I want to** start interacting with the bot  
**So that** I can begin organizing my information

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format):**
- WHEN a user sends /start command THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message with available commands
- WHEN an unauthorized user attempts to use the bot THEN the system SHALL display an authorization rejection message
- IF the user is authorized THEN the system SHALL allow full bot functionality

#### US-1.2: Message Processing
**As a** user  
**I want to** send any text to the bot  
**So that** it automatically organizes the information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user sends a text message THEN the system SHALL analyze content using GPT-4o
- WHEN content is analyzed THEN the system SHALL decide whether to merge with existing content or create new
- WHEN content is processed THEN the system SHALL preserve the original source with metadata
- WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL send a brief confirmation message

### 2. Smart Rails Routing

#### US-2.1: Deterministic Command Processing
**As a** user  
**I want to** use specific commands for different entity types  
**So that** the bot processes my requests accurately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user includes @username THEN the system SHALL extract it as assignee with 100% confidence
- WHEN a user includes /command THEN the system SHALL extract entity type/operation with 100% confidence
- WHEN preprocessing is complete THEN the system SHALL send only cleaned content to LLM

#### US-2.2: Entity Type Routing
**As a** user  
**I want to** work with different entity types  
**So that** information is organized appropriately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN /lists is used THEN the system SHALL route to list processor
- WHEN /tasks is used THEN the system SHALL route to task processor
- WHEN /reports is used THEN the system SHALL route to field report processor
- IF no explicit command is used THEN the system SHALL use pattern matching with confidence scoring

### 3. Storage and Retrieval

#### US-3.1: Document Storage
**As a** user  
**I want** my information stored persistently  
**So that** I can retrieve it later

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN content is created THEN the system SHALL store in Supabase with metadata
- WHEN content is stored THEN the system SHALL index in Upstash Vector for semantic search
- WHEN storing documents THEN the system SHALL maintain YAML frontmatter format
- IF storage fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff

#### US-3.2: Semantic Search
**As a** user  
**I want to** search for information using natural language  
**So that** I can find relevant content easily

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL perform semantic vector search
- WHEN search is performed THEN the system SHALL return top K relevant results
- IF vector search is enabled THEN the system SHALL use caching for performance
- WHEN results are found THEN the system SHALL synthesize an intelligent response

### 4. Memory Management (mem0)

#### US-4.1: Conversation Memory
**As a** user  
**I want** the bot to remember our conversations  
**So that** it maintains context over time

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a conversation occurs THEN the system SHALL extract important memories using mem0
- WHEN memories are extracted THEN the system SHALL store with user context
- IF graph memory is enabled THEN the system SHALL create relationship mappings
- WHEN /memories command is used THEN the system SHALL display user's memories

#### US-4.2: Memory Corrections
**As a** user  
**I want to** correct wrong memories  
**So that** the bot maintains accurate information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN /correct command is used THEN the system SHALL update the specified memory
- WHEN memory is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history
- IF webhooks are configured THEN the system SHALL send memory update notifications

### 5. Multi-User Support

#### US-5.1: User Authorization
**As an** administrator  
**I want to** control who can use the bot  
**So that** only authorized team members have access

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN checking authorization THEN the system SHALL verify against Supabase personnel table
- IF user has valid Telegram username in personnel table THEN the system SHALL grant access
- WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt

#### US-5.2: User Isolation
**As a** user  
**I want** my data isolated from other users  
**So that** information remains private

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL associate with user's Telegram ID
- WHEN retrieving data THEN the system SHALL filter by user context
- IF namespace isolation is enabled THEN the system SHALL use separate vector namespaces

### 6. Document Processing

#### US-6.1: File Upload Handling
**As a** user  
**I want to** upload documents to the bot  
**So that** their content becomes searchable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL download and process it
- WHEN processing PDFs THEN the system SHALL extract text content
- WHEN content exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL chunk into smaller pieces
- WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL index all chunks

### 7. Performance Requirements

#### NF-7.1: Response Time
- WHEN processing a message THEN the system SHALL respond within 5 seconds
- WHEN performing vector search THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds
- IF cache is enabled THEN the system SHALL serve cached results within 500ms

#### NF-7.2: Scalability
- The system SHALL support concurrent users without performance degradation
- The system SHALL handle documents up to 10MB in size
- The system SHALL maintain conversation history for configurable TTL

#### NF-7.3: Reliability
- The system SHALL retry failed operations with exponential backoff
- The system SHALL log all errors to Supabase for monitoring
- The system SHALL gracefully handle API failures with user-friendly messages

### 8. Deployment Requirements

#### US-8.1: Production Deployment
**As an** operations team  
**I want** the bot deployed on Render  
**So that** it's accessible 24/7

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL use webhook mode for efficiency
- WHEN webhook is configured THEN the system SHALL verify SSL certificate
- The system SHALL provide health check endpoint at /health
- The system SHALL expose metrics endpoint at /metrics

## Non-Functional Requirements
