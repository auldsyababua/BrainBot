This PR adds the missing /process endpoint that the Cloudflare Consumer Worker needs.

### Changes:
- Added /process endpoint with HMAC validation
- Added CF_PROXY_SECRET configuration
- Fixed integration between Cloudflare Workers and Render service

### Testing:
- [x] Endpoint responds to POST requests
- [x] HMAC validation works correctly
- [x] Telegram updates are processed

### Deployment:
This needs to be deployed immediately to fix production issues.
