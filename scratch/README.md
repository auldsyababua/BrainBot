# Scratch Directory

This directory contains temporary test scripts and one-off utilities for the markdown-brain-bot project.

## Current Files

- `test_full_content_search.py` - Test script for the new `search_with_full_content` method in `vector_store.py` that retrieves full document content from the filesystem after vector search.

## Usage

These scripts are temporary and used for development/testing purposes. They should not be considered part of the production codebase.
